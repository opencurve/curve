## Overview

Ansible is an automated operation and maintenance tool, and curve-ansible is a cluster deployment tool developed based on the ansible playbook. This document introduces how to quickly experience the CURVE distributed system: 1. Use curve-ansible to simulate the deployment steps of the production environment on a single machine. 2. Use curve-ansible to deploy the minimal production environment on multiple machines. For more usage and instructions of curve-ansible, please refer to [curve-ansible README](../../curve-ansible/README.md). **This article is for the latest version of the software package, please use the latest version of the package. If you encounter problems that are not described in the document during the installation process, please feedback via issue.**

## Tips

- Some external dependencies are installed through source code. During the installation process, downloading packages from github may time out. At this time, you can choose to retry or install manually. If jemalloc is installed manually, make sure that the prefix in configure is consistent with the 'lib_install_prefix' in server.ini and client.ini.

- If SElinux is turned on on the machine, it may report 'Aborting, target uses selinux but python bindings (libselinux-python) aren't installed', you can try to install 'libselinux-python', or close selinux forcibly.

- 'deploy_curve.yml' is used to deploy a brand new cluster. After the cluster is successfully set up, it cannot be run repeatedly because it will **disrupt the cluster**. You can choose to **start** the cluster or **clear** the cluster to redeploy. For detailed usage, see [curve-ansible README](../../curve-ansible/README.md).

- During the deployment process, you can always try again before the chunkserver is successfully started. **if you still want retry after the chunkserver is successfully started**, please use the '--skip-tags format', since it will clean up the data of the chunkserver that has been successfully started, thereby disrupting the cluster.

- If you need to use the curve-nbd function, there are two requirements for the kernel: The first is support the nbd module, you can 'modprobe nbd' to check whether the nbd module exists. The second is that the block size of the nbd device must be able to be set to 4KB. It has been verified in that CentOs8, which has been completely installed by [DVD1.iso](http://mirrors.163.com/centos/8/isos/x86_64/CentOS-8.2.2004-x86_64-dvd1.iso), the kernel version is 4.18. 0-193.el8.x86_64, which satisfies this condition.

## Deploy on single machine

- Scenes：hope to use a single Linux server to experience the smallest cluster of CURVE and simulate the production deployment steps.

We provide an all-in-one docker image. In this docker image, there are all compilation dependencies and running dependencies. Therefore, you can quickly deploy your own compiled code, of course, you can also choose to download the latest release package from github for deployment.

#### Prepare docker
Execute the following command to start docker:
   ```bash
   docker run --cap-add=ALL -v /dev:/dev -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules --privileged -it opencurve/curveintegration:centos8 /bin/bash
   ```

If you choose docker deployment, the following steps of [Prepare environment](./deploy_en.md#prepare-environment) can be skipped directly, and you can [Start deployment](./deploy_en.md#start-deployment).

#### Prepare environment

Prepare a deployment host to ensure that its software meets the requirements:

- It is recommended to install Debian9 or Centos7/8 (other environments have not been tested)
- The Linux operating system is open to external network access for downloading the installation package of CURVE
- Deployment needs to create a public user with root privileges
- Currently only supports deploying CURVE clusters on x86_64 (AMD64) architecture
- Install ansible 2.5.9 for cluster deployment (**Currently only ansible 2.5.9 version is supported, other versions will have syntax problems**)
- Install docker 18.09 for deploy snapshot clone server

The smallest CURVE cluster topology:

| Instance | number | IP      | configure                       |
| ----------- | ---- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| MDS         | 1    | 127.0.0.1 | port<br /> global directory configuration |
| Chunkserver | 3    | 127.0.0.1 | port<br /> global directory configuration |


##### steps for CentOs7/8 environment preparation
1. Log in to the machine as the root user and create a curve user:：

   ```bash
   $ adduser curve
   ```

2. Set up the curve user without secret sudo under root

   ```bash
   $ su  # switch to root user
   $ create a new file 'curve' under '/etc/sudoers.d'，add a line in it：curve ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   $ su curve  # switch to curve user
   $ sudo ls  # Test if sudo is configured correctly
   ```
3. Install ansible 2.5.9
   ```bash
   $ sudo yum install python2  # install python2
   $ ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python  # set default use python2
   $ pip2 install ansible==2.5.9  # install ansible
   $ ansible-playbook  # If no error is reported, the installation is successful, if an error is reported, perform the following two steps
   $ pip install --upgrade pip
   $ pip install --upgrade setuptools
   ```
4. Make sure there are the following packages in the source：net-tools, openssl>=1.1.1, perf, perl-podlators, make

##### steps for Debian9 environment preparation
1. Log in to the machine as the root user and create a curve user:：

   ```bash
   $ adduser curve
   ```

2. Set up the curve user without secret sudo

   ```bash
   $ su  # switch to root user
   $ apt install sudo  # install sudo，if not installed
   $ create a new file 'curve' under '/etc/sudoers.d'，add a line in it：curve ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   $ sudo -iu curve  # switch to curve user
   $ sudo ls  # Test if sudo is configured correctly
   ```
3. Install ansible 2.5.9
   ```bash
   $ apt install python
   $ apt install python-pip
   $ pip install ansible==2.5.9
   $ ansible-playbook  # If no error is reported, the installation is successful, if an error is reported, perform the following two steps
   $ pip install --upgrade pip
   $ pip install --upgrade setuptools
   ```
4. Make sure there are the following packages in the source：net-tools, openssl>=1.1.1, perf, perl-podlators, make

#### Start Deployment
1. Switch to curve user do the following step

2. Get tar package and unzip

   There are two way to get the tar package：
      1. Get from [github release page](https://github.com/opencurve/curve/releases) download stable release tar package
      2. Generate the tar package through the compilation environment by yourself, this way allows you to experience and testing the latest code：[Build compilation and development environment](build_and_run.md)

   ```
   # Get a tar package of a specific version（If you use method 2 to pack it yourself, you don’t need to download it, just copy the relevant tar package），The download command is for reference only, please use the latest version
   wget https://github.com/opencurve/curve/releases/download/v{version}/curve_{version}.tar.gz
   wget https://github.com/opencurve/curve/releases/download/v{version}/nbd_{version}.tar.gz
   wget https://github.com/opencurve/curve/releases/download/v{version}/nebd_{version}.tar.gz
   tar zxvf curve_{version}.tar.gz
   tar zxvf nbd_{version}.tar.gz
   tar zxvf nebd_{version}.tar.gz
   cd curve/curve-ansible
   ```
3. Deploy the cluster and start the service. If you need to use the snapshot clone features, please set disable_snapshot_clone=False in server.ini before executing the script.

   ```
   ansible-playbook -i server.ini deploy_curve.yml
   ```

4. If you need to use the snapshot clone features, you need a s3 acount, or use [netease objetct storage](https://www.163yun.com/product/nos)

   ```
   1. In server.ini，fill in the s3_nos_address，s3_snapshot_bucket_name，s3_ak and s3_sk。
   2. Install the snapshotclone service 
      ansible-playbook -i server.ini deploy_curve.yml --tags snapshotclone
      ansible-playbook -i server.ini deploy_curve.yml --tags snapshotclone_nginx
   ```

5. Execute commands to view the current cluster status, mainly watch the following status
   - In Cluster status, the total copysets must be 100，the unhealthy copysets must be 0
   - In Mds status, the current MDS must not be empty，the offline mds list must be empty
   - In Etcd status, the current etcd must not be empty ，the offline etcd list must be empty
   - In Chunkserver status, the offline chunkserver must be 0

   ```
   curve_ops_tool status
   ```

6. Install Nebd service和 NBD package

   ```
   ansible-playbook -i client.ini deploy_nebd.yml
   ansible-playbook -i client.ini deploy_nbd.yml
   ansible-playbook -i client.ini deploy_curve_sdk.yml
   ```

7. Create a CURVE volume and mount it locally via NBD。When creating a CURVE volume, it may report Fail to listen. This is a log printing problem and does not affect the results and can be ignored.

   ```
   1. Create a CURVE volume, the command is 'curve create [-h] --filename FILENAME --length LENGTH --user USER'， LENGTH >= 10。The unit of length is GB.
      curve create --filename /test --length 10 --user curve
   2. mount the volume
      sudo curve-nbd map cbd:pool//test_curve_
   3. Check the device is mount or not（In the docker environment，list-mapped will show nothing，you can use lsblk alternatively to see if there is a volume like /dev/nbd0）
      curve-nbd list-mapped
   ```


9. Deployment monitoring system (optional). For documentation on the monitoring system, see [curve monitoring system documentation](./monitor.md). The deployment of monitoring system requires docker orchestration. First of all, please make sure that docker and docker-compose are installed. Secondly, you need to download and decompress the tar package of curve-monitor in the same level directory of the curve package.

   ```
   ansible-playbook deploy_monitor.yml -i server.ini
   ```

## Deploy on multiple machines

- Scenes：Use multiple Linux servers to build a cluster with the smallest CURVE topology, which can be used for preliminary performance testing.

#### Prepare environment

Prepare a deployment host to ensure that its software meets the requirements:

- It is recommended to install Debian9 or Centos7/8
- The Linux operating system is open to external network access for downloading the installation package of CURVE
- Deployment needs to create a public user with root privileges
- The deployment host needs to open the required ssh port between the CURVE cluster nodes
- Currently only supports deploying CURVE clusters on x86_64 (AMD64) architecture
- Choose one of the three machines as the central control machine and install ansible 2.5.9 for cluster deployment (**Currently only supports deployment under ansible 2.5.9**) 
- Install docker 18.09 for deploy snapshot clone server

At the same time, ensure that each machine has at least one data disk that can be formatted for use by the chunkserver.

 CURVE cluster topology：

| Instance                                                     | number | IP                                               | port |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| MDS                                                          | 3      | 10.192.100.1<br />10.192.100.2<br />10.192.100.3 | 6666 |
| Chunkserver<br />(There are 10 disks on each of the three servers, and each server has 10 instances of Chunkserver) | 10 * 3 | 10.192.100.1<br />10.192.100.2<br />10.192.100.3 | 8200 |

##### steps for CentOs7/8 environment preparation
The following steps require three machines to operate:
1. Log in to the machine as the root user and create a curve user:：

   ```bash
   $ adduser curve
   ```

2. Set up the curve user without secret sudo

   ```bash
   $ su  # switch to root user
   $ create a new file 'curve' under '/etc/sudoers.d'，add a line in it：curve ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   $ su curve  # switch to curve user
   $ sudo ls  # Test if sudo is configured correctly
   ```
3. Make sure there are the following packages in the source：net-tools, openssl>=1.1.1, perf, perl-podlators, make

The following steps only need to be executed on the central control machine：
1. Configure ssh to log in to all machines (including yourself) under the curve user, assuming that the IPs of the three machines are 10.192.100.1, 10.192.100.2, 10.192.100.3
   ```bash
   $ su curve  # switch to curve user
   $ ssh-keygen  # generate ssh secret key
   $ ssh-copy-id curve@10.192.100.1  # copy the key to the first machine
   $ ssh-copy-id curve@10.192.100.2  # copy the key to the second machine
   $ ssh-copy-id curve@10.192.100.3  # copy the key to the second machine
   $ ssh 10.192.100.1   # Verify that the configuration is correct one by one
   ```
2. Install ansible 2.5.9
   ```bash
   $ sudo yum install python2  # Install python2
   $ ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python  # set default use python2
   $ pip2 install ansible==2.5.9  # Install ansible
   $ ansible-playbook  # If no error is reported, the installation is successful, if an error is reported, perform the following two steps
   $ pip install --upgrade pip
   $ pip install --upgrade setuptools

   # cluster topology
   cluster_map:
     servers:
       - name: server1
         internalip: 10.192.100.1       // The internal ip corresponding to the machine where the chunkserver is deployed is used for communication within the curve cluster (between mds and chunkserver and chunkserver)
         internalport: 0                // The internalport must be 0 in the case of multi-machine deployment, otherwise only the chunkserver of the corresponding port on the machine can be registered
         externalip: 10.192.100.1       // The external ip corresponding to the machine where the chunkserver is deployed is used to accept client requests and can be set to be consistent with the internal ip
         externalport: 0                // The externalport must be 0 in the case of multi-machine deployment, otherwise only the chunkserver of the corresponding port on the machine can be registered
         zone: zone1
         physicalpool: pool1
       - name: server2
         internalip: 10.192.100.2       // need change, refer to the previous server
         internalport: 0                // need change, refer to the previous server
         externalip: 10.192.100.2       // need change, refer to the previous server
         externalport: 0                // need change, refer to the previous server
         zone: zone2
         physicalpool: pool1
       - name: server3
         internalip: 10.192.100.3       // need change, refer to the previous server

         externalip: 10.192.100.3       // need change, refer to the previous server
         externalport: 0                // need change, refer to the previous server

         type: 0
         replicasnum: 3
         copysetnum: 300               // The number of copysets is related to the cluster size. It is recommended to average 100 copysets on a chunkserver. For example, for three machines, each with 3 disks is 3*3*100=900 copysets, divided by three copies is 300
         zonenum: 3
         scatterwidth: 0
   ```
   **group_vars/chunkservers.yml**
   Modified to the name list of specific disks on the machine, the number is not fixed.
   ```
   disk_list:
     - sda
     - sdb
     - sdc
   ```
   If the disk name of an individual chunkserver is different from others, it needs to be extracted separately and placed under host_vars. For example, in this example, assuming that the three disks on server1 and server2 are the same as sda, sdb, sdc, and group_vars, and server3 is sdd, sde, sdf, and sdg, then a server3 needs to be added under host_vars. yml, where the content is:
   ```
   disk_list:
     - sdd
     - sde
     - sdf
     - sdg
   ```

4. Deploy the cluster and start the service. The default concurrency of ansible is 5. If there are more than 5 machines, each step will be operated on the first 5 machines first, and then the next 5 machines will be operated after completion. If you want to increase the speed, you can add the -f [concurrent number] option after ansible-playbook.

   ```
   ansible-playbook -i server.ini deploy_curve.yml
   ```

5. If you need to use the snapshot clone features, you need a s3 acount, or use [netease objetct storage](https://www.163yun.com/product/nos)

   1. In server.ini，fill in the s3_nos_address，s3_snapshot_bucket_name，s3_ak and s3_sk,
 disable_snapshot_clone=False
   2. Install the snapshotclone service
   ```
      ansible-playbook -i server.ini deploy_curve.yml --tags snapshotclone
      ansible-playbook -i server.ini deploy_curve.yml --tags snapshotclone_nginx
   ```

6. Execute commands to view the current cluster status, mainly watch the following status
   - In Cluster status, the total copysets must be 100，the unhealthy copysets must be 0
   - In Mds status, the current MDS must not be empty，the offline mds list must be empty
   - In Etcd status, the current etcd must not be empty ，the offline etcd list must be empty
   - In Chunkserver status, the offline chunkserver must be 0

   ```
   curve_ops_tool status
   ```

7. Install Nebd service和 NBD package

   ```
   ansible-playbook -i client.ini deploy_nebd.yml
   ansible-playbook -i client.ini deploy_nbd.yml
   ansible-playbook -i client.ini deploy_curve_sdk.yml
   ```

8. Create a CURVE volume and mount it locally via NBD。When creating a CURVE volume, it may report Fail to listen. This is a log printing problem and does not affect the results and can be ignored.

   ```
   1. Create a CURVE volume, the command is 'curve create [-h] --filename FILENAME --length LENGTH --user USER'， LENGTH >= 10。The unit of length is GB.
      curve create --filename /test --length 10 --user curve
   2. mount the volume
      sudo curve-nbd map cbd:pool//test_curve_
   3. Check the device is mount or not（In the docker environment，list-mapped will show nothing，you can use lsblk alternatively to see if there is a volume like /dev/nbd0）
      curve-nbd list-mapped
   ```
