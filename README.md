##  About Curve

**Curve** is a modern storage system developed by netease, currently supporting file storage(CurveFS) and block storage(CurveBS). Now it's hosted at [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) as a sandbox project.

The core application scenarios of CurveBS mainly include:
- the performance, mixed, capacity cloud disk or persistent volume of virtual machine/container, and remote disks of physical machines
- high-performance separation of storage and computation architecture: high-performance and low latency architecture based on RDMA+SPDK, supporting the separation deployment structure of various databases such as MySQL and Kafka


The core application scenarios of CurveFS mainly include:
- the cost-effective storage in AI training scene
- the hot and cold data automation layered storage in big data scenarios
- the cost-effective shared file storage on the public cloud: It can be used for business scenarios such as AI, big data, file sharing
- Hybrid storage: Hot data is stored in the local IDC, cold data is stored in public cloud

- High Performance : CurveBS vs CephBS

  CurveBS: v1.2.0

  CephBS: L/N
  Performance:
  CurveBS random read and write performance far exceeds CephBS in the block storage scenario.

  EnvironmentÔºö3 replicas on a 6-node cluster, each node has 20xSATA SSD, 2xE5-2660 v4 and 256GB memory.

  Single VolÔºö

  Multi VolsÔºö
  <image src="docs/images/10-nbd-en.png">

- More stable
  - The stability of the common abnormal Curve is better than that of Ceph in the block storage scenario.
    | Fault Case | One Disk Failure | Slow Disk Detect | One Server Failure | Server Suspend Animation |
    | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
    | CephBS | jitter 7s | Continuous io jitter | jitter 7s | unrecoverable |
    | CurveBS | jitter 4s | no effect | jitter 4s | jitter 4s |

- Easy Operation
  - We have developed [CurveAdm](https://github.com/opencurve/curveadm/wiki) to help O&M staff.

- Use [Curve CSI Driver](https://github.com/opencurve/curve-csi), The plugin implements the Container Storage Interface(CSI) between Container Orchestrator(CO) and Curve cluster. It allows dynamically provisioning curve volumes and attaching them to workloads.
- For details of the documentation, see [CSI Curve Driver Doc](https://github.com/opencurve/curve-csi/blob/master/docs/README.md).

- It serves as the underlying storage base for [polardb for postgresql](https://github.com/ApsaraDB/PolarDB-for-PostgreSQL) in the form of storage and computation separation, providing data consistency assurance for upper layer database applications, extreme elasticity scaling, and high performance HTAP.

<details>
  <summary><b><font=4>Curve on Hybrid Cloud</b></font></summary>

Curve supports deployment in private and public cloud environments, and can also be used in a hybrid cloud:
<div align=center> <image src="docs/images/Curve-deploy-on-premises-idc.png" width=60%>
<div align=left>

One of them, CurveFS shared file storage system, can be elastically scaled to public cloud storage, which can provide users with greater capacity elasticity, lower cost, and better performance experience.

<details>
  <summary><b><font=4>Curve on Public Cloud</b></font></summary>

In a public cloud environment, users can deploy CurveFS clusters to replace the shared file storage system provided by cloud vendors and use cloud disks for acceleration, which can greatly reduce business costs, with the following deployment architecture:

##  CurveBS quick start
In order to improve the operation and maintenance convenience of Curve, we designed and developed the [CurveAdm](https://github.com/opencurve/curveadm) project, which is mainly used for deploying and managing Curve clusters. Currently, it supports the deployment of CurveBS & CurveFS (scaleout, upgrade and other functions are under development), please refer to the [CurveAdm User Manual](https://github.com/opencurve/curveadm/wiki) for related documentation, and install the CurveAdm tool according to the manual before deploying the Curve cluster.


###  Deploy an All-in-one experience environment

Please refer to the [CurveBS cluster deployment steps](https://github.com/opencurve/curveadm/wiki/curvebs-cluster-deployment) in the CurveAdm user manual. For standalone experience, please use the "Cluster Topology File - Standalone Deployment" template.

[The command tools' instructions](docs/cn/curve_ops_tool.md)
### FIO Curve block storage engine
Fio Curve engine is added, you can clone https://github.com/opencurve/fio and compile the fio tool with our engine(depend on nebd lib), fio command line example:
```bash
$ ./fio --thread --rw=randwrite --bs=4k --ioengine=nebd --nebd=cbd:pool//pfstest_test_ --iodepth=10 --runtime=120 --numjobs=10 --time_based --group_reporting --name=curve-fio-test
```

If you have any questions during performance testing, please check the [Curve block storage performance tuning guide](docs/cn/Curve%E5%9D%97%E5%AD%98%E5%82%A8%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E8%B0%83%E4%BC%98%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97.md).

##  CurveFS quick start
Please use [CurveAdm](https://github.com/opencurve/curveadm/wiki) tool to deploy CurveFSÔºåsee [CurveFS Deployment Process](https://github.com/opencurve/curveadm/wiki/curvefs-cluster-deployment), and the [CurveFS Command Instructions](curvefs/src/tools#readme).

##  Contribute us
Participation in the Curve project is described in the [Curve Developers Guidelines](developers_guide.md) and is subject to a [contributor contract](https://github.com/opencurve/curve/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
We welcome your contribution!

## Code of Conduct
Curve follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## LICENSE
Curve is distributed under the [**Apache 2.0 LICENSE**](LICENSE).

##  Release Cycle
- CURVE release cycleÔºöHalf a year for major version, 1~2 months for minor version

- Versioning format: We use a sequence of three digits and a suffix (x.y.z{-suffix}), x is the major version, y is the minor version, and z is for bugfix. The suffix is for distinguishing beta (-beta), RC (-rc) and GA version (without any suffix). Major version x will increase 1 every half year, and y will increase every 1~2 months. After a version is released, number z will increase if there's any bugfix.

## Branch
All the developments will be done under master branch. If there's any new version to establish, a new branch release-x.y will be pulled from the master, and the new version will be released from this branch.

## Contributors
This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
