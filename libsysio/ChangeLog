*Added mount() api call to support sub-mounts.

*Added rudimentary automounts per the namespace chapter in the "Lustre
Architecture Reference". Note, full URI support is not implemented. See
the README for details.

Think I have it going for simultaneous 32/64 bit support. Together with
the nagging build for test_stat.

*Miscellaneous bugs fixed.

*Added "incore" file system. An in-memory file system solving boot-strap
and other annoying little chicken-and-the-egg problems.

*Added support for devices

*Added support for accessing the pre-opened standard file descriptors 0, 1,
and 2 via the stdfd device driver (major number 0, minor 0, 1, and 2).

*Altered the internal interface to pass the xtvec (see .../include/xtio.h) in
order to support strided-io.
